# 🕵️‍♂️ TCPdump: Capturing & Analyzing Network Traffic Like a Pro!

**Welcome to the thrilling world of network traffic analysis!** In this lab, I harnessed the mighty power of `tcpdump` to capture and analyze various types of network traffic. ICMP, ARP, and even some sneaky man-in-the-middle attacks got caught in my digital net. Let’s just say, nothing escapes the watchful eye of `tcpdump`—not even a rogue ping! 😉

## 🚀 What’s Inside?

1. **Capturing ICMP Traffic**:  
   🖥️ From Kali to SecOnion, I initiated pings and captured the sweet flow of ICMP traffic. Each packet was recorded like a top-secret message!
   
2. **Saving Traffic for Later**:  
   📁 Saving network captures for a rainy day? Easy! All traffic was logged into a `.pcap` file, perfect for analyzing with Wireshark (because who doesn’t love fancy GUI tools?).

3. **ARP Spoofing Adventures**:  
   🕵️ I pretended to be someone else on the network using `arpspoof`, hijacking traffic like a sneaky agent. Don't worry, it’s all for educational purposes. 😇

4. **Analyzing with Wireshark**:  
   🔬 Opened up Wireshark, dissected the packets, and saw *everything*. From FTP credentials flying in plain text to HTTP traffic—nothing was safe.

## 🛠️ Tools I Used

- **tcpdump**: The Swiss Army knife of packet capture.
- **Wireshark**: Because pretty graphs make packet analysis more fun.
- **arpspoof**: The tool you need when you want to… pretend you're someone else on the network.

## 🔑 Why Should You Care?

In the world of cybersecurity, network traffic is where all the action happens. Understanding how to capture and analyze it is a critical skill to identify and mitigate threats, detect intrusions, and keep your network safe from those pesky bad actors. This lab shows you how to become a traffic whisperer—*and trust me, it's cooler than it sounds*.

**Pro-tip**: If anyone asks, I’m just capturing packets, not hearts. 💔✨
